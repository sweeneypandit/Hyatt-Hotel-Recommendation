# Hyatt-Hotel-Recommendation
This is a data science project on hyatt hotel recommendation analysis to analyse the factors that favour good customer rating and vice versa.
I started of with first subsetting the data because it was a vast file with more than 200 columns and 1 million rows.I decided to go ahead with
quarter analysis for USA Hyatt Hotels and later narrowed down to california. The KPI's for my dataset were Likelihood to Recommend(on scale
of 1-7) and NPS Type(Promoters or Detractors). I considered location, guest country, gender, age range, purpose of visit, member class as some
of the major columns for my analysis. I performed exploratory analysis on them and visualised the same using ggplot. I in the end performed
association rule mining to see how the facilities provided by the hotel support NPS Type.
So all in one this R file will give you some insight on data wrangling, visualizing, mining and descriptive analysis.
